This project is for the introductory course in AI for FLorida Atlantic University in collaboration with Elizabeth J.
EasyAI is credited to Zulko (https://github.com/Zulko/easyAI) and is used as the backbone for AI implementation.
The file to which certain functions were left blank for the purpose of filling them in is checker.py
We used pytest during the creative process.
